# Command Line Chatbot with OpenAI API

Based on script from: [Gynvael Coldwind's amazing blog](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&id=771)

This repository contains a simple Python script that utilizes the OpenAI API to create a command line coding helper. The script takes a system command and a problem, interacts with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate a solution.

## Notes

- The script uses the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate descriptions. You can experiment with other models by modifying the `model` parameter in the script.
- The generated description may not always be accurate or up-to-date. It's important to verify the information provided.
