Command Line Chatbot with OpenAI API
This repository contains a simple Python script that utilizes the OpenAI API to create a command line chatbot. The script takes a system command and its arguments as input, interacts with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate a description of the command, and then prints the generated description.

Prerequisites
Before using this script, you need to have the following:

Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
OpenAI API Key: You need an OpenAI API key to authenticate your requests to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai
Usage
Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
Run the script with the desired command and its arguments:

bash
Copy code
python chatbot.py <system> <arguments>
Replace <system> with the name of the command and <arguments> with the arguments you want to pass to the command.

Example
For instance, if you want to get a description of the ls command, you can run:

bash
Copy code
python chatbot.py ls
The script will interact with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate a description of the ls command and its usage.

Output
The script will print the generated description of the command obtained from the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

Notes
The script uses the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate descriptions. You can experiment with other models by modifying the model parameter in the script.
The generated description may not always be accurate or up-to-date. It's important to verify the information provided.
